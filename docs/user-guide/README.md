# YourBase, the development platform for growing teams

YourBase is an open-source platform for the development of services that scales with a growing team. It can be used to build and manage polyglot, domain-specific and independently released services - often called microservices. Our main goals:

* be very easy to get started
* nicely scale from small teams to large ones and perhaps help build the next Google or Facebook ;-)
