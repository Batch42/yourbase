# YourBase, the development platform for growing teams

YourBase is an open-source platform for the development of services that scales with a growing team. It can be used to build and manage polyglot, domain-specific and independently released services - often called microservices. Our main goals:

* be very easy to get started
* scale from small teams to large ones and perhaps help build the next Google or Facebook ;-)
* enforce uniformity between apps of the same type (e.g: "Go REST API Server" or "Java Spring REST API Server") to simplify debugging and maintenance

## Background

* [Moving beyond the software monolith](beyond-the-monolith.md)

# Next Steps

* [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
* [How Does it Work](how-does-it-work.md)
* [Developing Services](developing-services.md)
